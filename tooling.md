# Tooling

The site is hosted in GitHub pages as a statically generated website. The GitHub repository is [https://github.com/hectorcorrea/hectorcorrea.github.io](https://github.com/hectorcorrea/hectorcorrea.github.io)

Below are some of tools that I use to build it:

* [fixie](https://github.com/hectorcorrea/fixie) to generate the HTML from Markdown files.
* The CSS for the site comes from [new.css](https://newcss.net/)
* The search is implemented with [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) and the search highlighting is done via [Mark.js](https://markjs.io/)
